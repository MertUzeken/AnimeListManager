# AnimeListManager


This project was part of my last examination for the Python class at my semester abroad in Thailand.
The Idea is to have a program which gathers your Anime list locally, so you can View them at any time.

Further on the Idea is to improve it with feature such as search, edit, add and remove titles.


I coulnd't finish it in time due to time / visa circumstances which made me leave a week earlier.

Fast forward few month's later after my summer semester finished I picked it up again and done some work.


ToDo: 

1. Clean up the code from unused dependencies and old code.
2. Rename classes and functions with meaningful names, making them easier to understand for everyone.
3. Get UI back to work
4. Add functions to each button
5. Search function
6. Preferences
7. Updater for the local list
